<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Motivation</h3>



<p>At ThingsBoard, we&#8217;ve gained a lot of experience in building scalable IoT applications, which has helped us identify two main scenarios for MQTT-based solutions. In the first scenario, numerous devices generate a large volume of messages that are consumed by specific applications, resulting in a fan-in pattern. Normally, a few applications are set up to handle these lots of incoming data. They must be persistent clients with a Quality of Service (QoS) level set to 1 or 2, capable of retaining all the data even when they&#8217;re temporarily offline due to restarts or upgrades. This ensures applications don&#8217;t miss any single message. On the other hand, the second scenario involves numerous devices subscribing to specific updates or notifications that must be delivered. This leads to a few incoming requests that cause a high volume of outgoing data. This case is known as a fan-out pattern. Acknowledging these scenarios, we intentionally designed TBMQ to be exceptionally well-suited for both.</p>



<p>Our design principles focused on ensuring the broker’s fault tolerance and high availability. Thus, we deliberately avoided reliance on master or coordinated processes. We ensured the same functionality across all nodes within the cluster.</p>



<p>We prioritized supporting distributed processing, allowing for effortless horizontal scalability as our operations grow. We wanted our broker to support high-throughput and guarantee low-latency delivery of messages to clients. Ensuring data durability and replication was crucial in our design. We aimed for a system where once the broker acknowledges receiving a message, it remains safe and won’t be lost.</p>



<p>To ensure the fulfillment of the above requirements and prevent message loss in the case of clients or some of the broker instances failures, TBMQ uses the powerful capabilities of&nbsp;<a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a>&nbsp;as its underlying infrastructure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How does TBMQ work in a nutshell?</h3>



<p>Kafka plays a crucial role in various stages of the MQTT message processing. All unprocessed published messages, client sessions, and subscriptions are stored within dedicated Kafka topics. A comprehensive list of Kafka topics used within TBMQ is available&nbsp;<a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/mqtt-broker/architecture/#kafka-topics">here</a>. All broker nodes can readily access the most up-to-date states of client sessions and subscriptions by utilizing these topics. They maintain local copies of sessions and subscriptions for efficient message processing and delivery. When a client loses connection to a specific broker node, other nodes can seamlessly continue operations based on the latest state. Additionally, newly added broker nodes to the cluster get this vital information upon their activation.</p>



<p>Client subscriptions hold significant importance within the MQTT publish/subscribe pattern. TBMQ employs the&nbsp;<a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/mqtt-broker/architecture/#subscriptions-trie">Trie</a>&nbsp;data structure to optimize performance, enabling efficient persistence of client subscriptions in memory and facilitating swift access to relevant topic patterns.</p>



<p>Upon a publisher client sending a&nbsp;<em>PUBLISH</em>&nbsp;message, it is stored in the initial Kafka topic,&nbsp;<strong>tbmq.msg.all</strong>. Once Kafka acknowledges the message’s persistence, the broker promptly responds to the publisher with either a&nbsp;<em>PUBACK</em>/<em>PUBREC</em>&nbsp;message or no response at all, depending on the chosen QoS level.</p>



<p>Subsequently, separate threads, functioning as Kafka consumers, retrieve messages from the mentioned Kafka topic and utilize the Subscription Trie data structure to identify the intended recipients. Depending on the client type (<strong><em>DEVICE</em></strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong><em>APPLICATION</em></strong>) and the persistence options described below, the broker either redirects the message to another specific Kafka topic or directly delivers it to the recipient.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Non-persistent client</h4>



<p>A client is classified as a non-persistent one when the following conditions are met in the&nbsp;<em>CONNECT</em>&nbsp;packet:</p>



<p>For&nbsp;<strong>MQTT v3.x</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>clean_session</code>&nbsp;flag is set to&nbsp;<em>true</em>.</li>
</ul>



<p>For&nbsp;<strong>MQTT v5</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>clean_start</code>&nbsp;flag is set to&nbsp;<em>true</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>sessionExpiryInterval</code>&nbsp;is set to&nbsp;<em>0</em>&nbsp;or not specified.</li>
</ul>



<p>In the case of non-persistent clients, all messages intended for them are published directly without undergoing additional persistence. It is important to note that non-persistent clients can only be of type Device.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="355" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tbmq-non-persistent-dev-1024x355.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4143" style="width:800px;height:auto" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tbmq-non-persistent-dev-1024x355.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tbmq-non-persistent-dev-300x104.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tbmq-non-persistent-dev-768x266.png 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tbmq-non-persistent-dev-512x177.png 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tbmq-non-persistent-dev-920x319.png 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tbmq-non-persistent-dev.png 1190w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Persistent client</h4>



<p>MQTT clients that do not meet the non-persistent conditions mentioned above are categorized as persistent clients. Let’s delve into the conditions for persistent clients:</p>



<p>For&nbsp;<strong>MQTT v3.x</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>clean_session</code>&nbsp;flag is set to&nbsp;<em>false</em>.</li>
</ul>



<p>For&nbsp;<strong>MQTT v5 clients</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>sessionExpiryInterval</code>&nbsp;is greater than&nbsp;<em>0</em>&nbsp;(regardless of the&nbsp;<code>clean_start</code>&nbsp;flag).</li>



<li><code>clean_start</code>&nbsp;flag is set to&nbsp;<em>false</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>sessionExpiryInterval</code>&nbsp;is set to&nbsp;<em>0</em>&nbsp;or not specified.</li>
</ul>



<p>Building on our knowledge within the IoT ecosystem and the successful implementation of numerous IoT use cases, we have classified MQTT clients into two distinct categories:</p>



<ul>
<li>The&nbsp;<em>DEVICE</em>&nbsp;clients primarily engaged in publishing a significant volume of messages while subscribing to a limited number of topics with relatively low message rates. These clients are typically associated with IoT devices or sensors that frequently transmit data to the broker.</li>



<li>The&nbsp;<em>APPLICATION</em>&nbsp;clients specialize in subscribing to topics with high message rates. They often require messages to be persisted when the client is offline with later delivery, ensuring the availability of crucial data. These clients are commonly used for real-time analytics, data processing, or other application-level functionalities.</li>
</ul>



<p>Consequently, we made a strategic decision to optimize performance by separating the processing flow for these two types of clients.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Persistent Device client</h5>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="492" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tbmq-persistent-dev-1024x492.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4145" style="width:800px;height:auto" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tbmq-persistent-dev-1024x492.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tbmq-persistent-dev-300x144.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tbmq-persistent-dev-768x369.png 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tbmq-persistent-dev-512x246.png 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tbmq-persistent-dev-920x442.png 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tbmq-persistent-dev.png 1190w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>For Device persistent clients, we use the&nbsp;<strong>tbmq.msg.persisted</strong>&nbsp;Kafka topic as a means of processing published messages that are extracted from the&nbsp;<strong>tbmq.msg.all</strong>&nbsp;topic. Dedicated threads, functioning as Kafka consumers, retrieve these messages and store them in a&nbsp;<a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/mqtt-broker/architecture/#postgresql-database">PostgreSQL</a>&nbsp;database utilized for persistence storage. This approach is particularly suitable for Device clients, as they typically do not require extensive message reception. This approach helps us recover stored messages smoothly when a client reconnects. At the same time, it ensures good performance for scenarios involving a low incoming message rate.</p>



<p>We expect persistent Device clients to receive no more than 5K messages/second overall due to PostgreSQL limitations. We plan to add support for Redis to optimize persistent storage for Device clients.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Persistent Application client<a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uuBU8T1C--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0kwq6574pa4c0m1s5ygd.png"></a></h5>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="358" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tbmq-app-1024x358.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4147" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tbmq-app-1024x358.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tbmq-app-300x105.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tbmq-app-768x269.png 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tbmq-app-512x179.png 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tbmq-app-920x322.png 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tbmq-app.png 1178w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The number of Application clients corresponds to the number of Kafka topics used. The latest version of Kafka can handle millions of topics, making this design suitable even for the largest enterprise use cases.</p>



<p>Any message read from the&nbsp;<strong>tbmq.msg.all</strong>&nbsp;topic meant for a specific Application client is then stored in the corresponding Kafka topic. A separate thread (Kafka consumer) is assigned to each Application. These threads retrieve messages from the corresponding Kafka topics and deliver them to the respective clients. This approach significantly improves performance by ensuring efficient message delivery. Additionally, the nature of the Kafka consumer group makes the&nbsp;<a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/mqtt-broker/user-guide/shared-subscriptions/#application-client-type">MQTT 5 shared subscription</a>&nbsp;feature extremely efficient for Application clients.</p>



<p>Application clients can handle a large volume of received messages, reaching millions per second.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Summary</h3>



<p>In conclusion, TBMQ&#8217;s design emphasizes meeting the complex demands of IoT communication. It prioritizes scalability, fault tolerance, and efficiency, relying on Kafka for reliable message handling across various scenarios.</p>



<p>By distinguishing processing strategies for Device and Application clients, TBMQ optimizes message persistence and guarantees consistent and fast message delivery.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px">In today&#8217;s fast-paced world, the convenience of smart parking solutions can&#8217;t be overstated. In this article, we’ll delve into the process of building a user-friendly Mobile Parking application using ThingsBoard, an IoT platform, and integrating it with Stripe for seamless online payments.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Concept Overview</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The mobile app aims to simplify the parking experience. It allows users to find available parking spots, start and end parking sessions, and handle payments &#8211; all without leaving their cars. Key features include real-time parking availability, cost information, parking history, and the ability to delay payment with a reminder system.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="363" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/scheme-parking-1024x363.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4109" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/scheme-parking-1024x363.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/scheme-parking-300x106.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/scheme-parking-768x273.png 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/scheme-parking-1536x545.png 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/scheme-parking-2048x727.png 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/scheme-parking-512x182.png 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/scheme-parking-920x327.png 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/scheme-parking-1600x568.png 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/scheme-parking-3200x1136.png 3200w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/scheme-parking-1920x681.png 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/scheme-parking.png 3212w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Stripe Integration</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">We chose Stripe as our payment system because of its robust features and ease of integration. While Stripe serves as an example, the principles outlined can apply to other payment systems, depending on your specific needs.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Firstly, you need to create an account on Stripe. Then, on the ThingsBoard side, implement a custom endpoint to generate payment links. Once the parking price is calculated, use the specific methods provided by the Stripe extension in Java to create a payment on Stripe. Then, get a link from the created payment to forward the end user to the payment page.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">After that, create another custom endpoint for payment confirmation on the ThingsBoard side and integrate this endpoint with the Stripe as a webhook. Once the end user enters payment details and clicks the pay button, Stripe will trigger ThingsBoard to update the payment status as confirmed or failed.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">User Capabilities</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">With this app, users can:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Locate their position and nearby available parking spots</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Start and end parking sessions</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">View and pay parking charges, either immediately or later</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Receive notifications for unpaid parking charges</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Track and analyze their parking history and expenses</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="550" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/User-Capabilities3-1024x550.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-4154" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/User-Capabilities3-1024x550.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/User-Capabilities3-300x161.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/User-Capabilities3-768x412.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/User-Capabilities3-1536x824.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/User-Capabilities3-2048x1099.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/User-Capabilities3-512x275.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/User-Capabilities3-920x494.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/User-Capabilities3-1600x859.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/User-Capabilities3-1920x1031.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/User-Capabilities3.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">System Hierarchy</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">In our solution, the hierarchy is straightforward: we have Parking spots that act as Assets and self-registered Users who will use our application for parking. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Parking spots have geofencing zones, and colored markers on a map indicate their occupancy. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Users will be able to see their location on the map with a car marker, ensuring that each user is represented by a car on the map.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Payment information will be saved as JSON telemetry on both the parking spot and user entities. This information will include details about the start and end of the parking period, total cost, payment link, and payment status.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">During the parking period, an additional custom relation should be created between the parking spot and the user. This relation should be removed after successful payment for parking services.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Front-End (FE) Development</h4>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Dashboard: Create a map showing parking spots and a telemetry table for parking history.
<ul>
<li>Parking spots act as assets with the Asset Profile “Parking Spot”. The geofence attribute is “perimeter”, while coordinates are denoted by standard names “longitude” and “latitude”. The occupancy status of each spot will be represented by zone and marker color: red &#8211; occupied, green &#8211; free spot</li>



<li>User’s parking history will be saved as telemetry data, so users will be able to trace their previous parking periods</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Widgets: Configure <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/mobile/mobile-actions/">mobile actions</a> for map interactions and historical data review.
<ul>
<li>Use mobile actions to get the phone’s location that allows the user to set their current coordinates on a map, start/finish the parking period by clicking on a parking spot on the map</li>



<li>Add action for checking data from the parking record</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Geofences: Set up perimeters for parking lots and mark them on the map.
<ul>
<li>Set parking spot perimeter as geofencing polygon on a map</li>



<li>Adjust the perimeter color based on spot occupancy</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">User Interactions: Enable the tooltip for checking parking information.
<ul>
<li>Tooltips on markers provide additional information about parking spots, like occupancy, price, name, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Message publishing</strong>: Conveniently publish messages with the ability to customize various MQTT-related settings for tailored communication.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">MQTT 5: Flow Control</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="365" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2-1024x365.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4028" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2-1024x365.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2-300x107.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2-768x274.png 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2-1536x547.png 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2-2048x729.png 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2-512x182.png 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2-920x328.png 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2-1600x570.png 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2-3200x1140.png 3200w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2-1920x684.png 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/flow-control2-2.png 3212w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">This update contains the Flow Control feature, a crucial enhancement for managing the rate of message flow in MQTT communications. This feature is particularly important in scenarios where clients or brokers have limited processing capabilities or bandwidth.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>How It Works:</strong> Flow Control in MQTT 5 is achieved through a key parameter: Receive Maximum. It dictates the maximum number of QoS 1 and QoS 2 messages that the client or broker is willing to process concurrently. Receive Maximum is exchanged within the CONNECT and CONNACK packets. Its default value is 65,535 based on the MQTT specification.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Why It&#8217;s Needed:</strong> Flow Control is an essential mechanism for several reasons:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Preventing overload:</strong> Without Flow Control, there&#8217;s a risk of overwhelming a client or broker with more messages than it can process. This can lead to system lags, or in worst-case scenarios, cause crashes or unresponsiveness, particularly in smaller, less powerful devices.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Ensuring reliable communication:</strong> By controlling the flow of messages, MQTT ensures that data transmission remains stable and reliable.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Optimizing resource use:</strong> Flow Control allows for the efficient use of system resources. It ensures that devices are not bogged down by unnecessary processing tasks, which is particularly important in systems with limited computational power.</li>
</ul>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Use Case</strong>: It can be any scenario (e.g. a smart home system or a traffic management system) where devices are constrained by processing power and cannot handle transmitting or receiving large amounts of data efficiently.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">MQTT 5: Request-Response pattern</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="428" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2-1024x428.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4029" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2-1024x428.png 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2-300x126.png 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2-768x321.png 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2-1536x643.png 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2-2048x857.png 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2-512x214.png 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2-920x385.png 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2-1600x669.png 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2-3200x1339.png 3200w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2-1920x803.png 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/request-response2.png 3212w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">The MQTT 5 Request-Response pattern introduces a structured approach to communication, enabling devices to send requests and receive responses in a reliable and efficient manner.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>How It Works:</strong> In the Request-Response pattern, a client sends a request message to a specific topic, typically indicating the action it wants to perform. This request includes essential parameters such as the Response Topic and Correlation Data. The recipient, which may be another client or application, processes the request and issues a corresponding response message directed to the specified Response Topic. This response provides the result or acknowledgment of the request. Utilizing Correlation Data, the original requester can precisely match the received response to its corresponding request, ensuring seamless bidirectional communication.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Why It&#8217;s Needed:</strong> The Request-Response pattern addresses the need for synchronous communication in IoT systems, where devices often require immediate feedback or confirmation for their actions. By establishing a structured request-response flow, MQTT 5 ensures a reliable and timely exchange of information between devices and applications.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Use Case:</strong> Consider a home automation scenario where a user wants to remotely control their smart lights. The user sends a request message to the TBMQ, specifying the action to turn on the lights. The broker transmits the request to the receiver which executes the action and sends the response message back to the user, confirming that the lights have been successfully turned on. This bidirectional communication allows for seamless interaction between the user and the smart home system, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Other notable enhancements</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">In addition to the features highlighted earlier, this release includes several points that strengthen the system&#8217;s reliability and efficiency. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Significant enhancements have been made in backpressure management specifically for non-persistent subscribers. This improvement allows the system to handle data flow surges for these subscribers more efficiently by implementing rate limits. As a result, it ensures the system&#8217;s stability, maintaining consistent performance even under conditions of high demand.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The enhancement of the disconnect client command with Reason Codes marks a notable improvement, offering clearer insights into disconnection causes (e.g. &#8220;Session taken over&#8221;, &#8220;Administrative action&#8221;) and facilitating more targeted troubleshooting and analysis.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">This version brings improvements in memory usage and overall performance. An important resolution of a direct memory leak issue leads to an optimized operational environment. This results in reduced latency and higher throughput, significantly boosting the system&#8217;s performance and robustness.</p>

<p>The update introduces new grouping intervals for dashboard <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/pe/user-guide/dashboards/#timewindow" data-type="link" data-id="https://thingsboard.io/docs/pe/user-guide/dashboards/#timewindow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time window</a> configurations: <strong>Week (Sun-Sat)</strong>, <strong>Week (Mon-Sun)</strong>, <strong>Month</strong>, and <strong>Quarter</strong>. The intervals adjust to the browser&#8217;s time zone by default, but there&#8217;s also the option to set a custom time zone for further customization. These additions allow for more flexible and granular data visualization and analysis.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Button widgets</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="802" height="263" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-widgets.webp" alt="Five blocks with icons and text" class="wp-image-3794" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-widgets.webp 802w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-widgets-300x98.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-widgets-768x252.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-widgets-512x168.webp 512w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /></figure>



<p>We&#8217;ve improved our platform with the new button widgets: the <strong>Action Button</strong> <strong>widget </strong>for navigation to other dashboards, states, or custom actions; the <strong>Command Button</strong> <strong>widget</strong> for sending commands to devices, updating attributes, or appending time-series data; the <strong>Toggle Button</strong> <strong>widget</strong> for switching between two device states; the <strong>Power Button</strong> <strong>widget</strong> for toggling the device on and off. Each widget is designed to offer users more control and interactivity within the platform, improving the overall experience. Explore the full potential of the new button widgets in the dedicated <a href="https://thingsboard.io/blog/iot-widgets-for-enhanced-dashboards-introducing-the-action-command-toggle-and-power-buttons/" data-type="link" data-id="/blog/iot-widgets-for-enhanced-dashboards-introducing-the-action-command-toggle-and-power-buttons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Control widgets</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="802" height="305" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Control-widgets.webp" alt="Three blocks with toggle button and one with slider" class="wp-image-3795" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Control-widgets.webp 802w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Control-widgets-300x114.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Control-widgets-768x292.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Control-widgets-512x195.webp 512w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /></figure>



<p>We&#8217;re introducing Control widgets: the <strong>Slider Widget</strong> and the <strong>Toggle Button Widget</strong>. Both widgets have a simple configuration interface and allow users to trigger commands to devices, update attributes, or append time-series data for the target entity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Alarm comment support for edge instances</h2>



<p>This feature enables bidirectional synchronization of comments on alarms between edge and cloud instances. With this update, users can seamlessly add comments to alarms directly within the Edge environment, and these comments are synchronized with the ThingsBoard cloud instance in real time, ensuring consistency and transparency throughout the entire system. Additionally, comments added or modified in the cloud instance are automatically propagated to the Edge environment, ensuring that all operators have access to the latest information regardless of their location or the system they are using.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Now, you can receive instant alerts and updates directly on your smartphone, making it easier than ever to stay connected with your IoT devices. Whether you&#8217;re monitoring temperature changes, tracking device status, or just want to stay informed, our new push notifications ensure you&#8217;re always in the loop. Get ready to elevate your IoT experience with real-time alerts wherever you are.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Firebase setup</h4>



<p>To deliver notifications from ThingsBoard instances to mobile apps, we utilize <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Firebase</a>. To set up push notifications, create a Firebase project and provide the necessary Firebase credentials to both the platform instance and the mobile application. For setup instructions, community edition users should follow this community edition <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/mobile/getting-started/#step-4-optional-configure-push-notifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guide</a>, while professional edition users can refer to the professional edition <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/pe/mobile/getting-started/#step-4-optional-configure-push-notifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guide</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to Use Notifications</h4>



<p>After setting up the platform and your app, you can start using the notification center to send out alerts. You can do this in two ways: manually or automatically with notification rules.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Sending Notifications Manually</h5>



<p>Open the &#8220;New notification&#8221; wizard by following this <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/notifications/#send-notification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guide</a>. Specify target recipients and choose &#8220;Mobile app&#8221; as the method for sending your notification. Please note that the recipient must install and login to the mobile application before the notifications may be sent. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1920" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1.webp" alt="Thingsboard edit rule settings form with eight fields" class="wp-image-3870" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-300x239.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-1024x816.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-768x612.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-1536x1224.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-2048x1632.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-512x408.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-920x733.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-1600x1275.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sending-Notifications-Manually-1-1920x1530.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p>In the next step, you&#8217;ll be able to personalize your notification. This includes choosing a subject, writing the message, and picking a custom icon to appear in the mobile app&#8217;s notification section.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="2070" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1.webp" alt="Thingsboard new notification settings form with four fields" class="wp-image-3871" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-300x258.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-1024x880.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-768x660.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-1536x1320.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-2048x1760.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-512x440.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-920x791.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-1600x1375.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-notification-1-1920x1650.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p>Notifications can do more than just inform; they can also take users somewhere specific. There are two options for what happens when someone taps on a notification:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Open URL:</strong> This can be any link, inside or outside the app. For internal links, you can direct users to pages like home, alarms, devices, assets, or customers by using these shortcuts: <code>/home</code>,<code> /alarms</code>, <code>/devices</code>, <code>/assets</code>,<code> /customers</code>, <code>/auditLogs</code>.</li>



<li><strong>Open Dashboard:</strong> This option works just like it does for web notifications, taking the user directly to a specific dashboard.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you don&#8217;t set up a tap action, tapping the notification will bring up the notifications page by default.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="880" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-1024x880.webp" alt="Smartphone with thingsboard notifications on the screen" class="wp-image-3872" style="width:801px;height:auto" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-1024x880.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-300x258.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-768x660.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-1536x1320.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-2048x1760.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-512x440.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-920x791.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-1600x1375.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2-1920x1650.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/notification-mobile-2.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Notification Rules</h5>



<p>Notification rules are your go-to tool for automating alerts based on specific events, making it a breeze to keep everyone informed without manual intervention. A common scenario is sending out alerts for new alarms. These rules can handle everything from simple notifications to complex escalation chains and are highly customizable. Learn more about notification rules <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/notifications/#alarm-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. See the default rule below. This rule sends information about new alarm to all tenant administrators:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="2466" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1.webp" alt="Thingsboard edit rule settings form with six fields" class="wp-image-3873" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-293x300.webp 293w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-1000x1024.webp 1000w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-768x786.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-1500x1536.webp 1500w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-2001x2048.webp 2001w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-512x524.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-1024x1048.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-920x942.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-1600x1638.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-rule-1-1920x1965.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p>Each rule is associated with a notification <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/notifications/#templates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">template</a>, which defines the delivery method and appearance of notifications. To get started with push notifications for new alarms, modify the &#8220;New Alarm Notification&#8221; template to include the &#8220;Mobile app&#8221; delivery option.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1977" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1.webp" alt="Thingsboard edit notification template settings form with eight fields" class="wp-image-3874" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-300x246.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-1024x840.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-768x630.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-1536x1261.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-2048x1681.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-512x420.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-920x755.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-1600x1313.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-01-1-1920x1576.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p>You can either reuse the message and subject from web notification or create your own. To make your notifications more engaging and relevant, use dynamic content like <code>alarmType</code> and <code>alarmOriginatorName</code>. A full list of available parameters can be found in the built-in documentation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="2040" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1.webp" alt="Thingsboard edit notification template settings form with four fields" class="wp-image-3875" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-300x254.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-1024x867.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-768x650.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-1536x1301.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-2048x1734.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-512x434.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-920x779.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-1600x1355.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Edit-notification-template-02-1-1920x1626.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p>After setting up your notification templates, you&#8217;re all set to see them in action without the need for any extra setup. For instance, by using the already available <code>Air Quality Monitoring</code> solution template, you can immediately start receiving notifications triggered by the predefined alarms in this solution. This approach lets you quickly validate your notification settings and ensure everything works seamlessly right out of the gate.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="880" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-1024x880.webp" alt="Smartphone with thingsboard alarm notifications on the screen" class="wp-image-3876" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-1024x880.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-300x258.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-768x660.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-1536x1320.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-2048x1760.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-512x440.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-920x791.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-1600x1375.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1-1920x1650.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Notifications-03-1.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Don&#8217;t stop at alarm notifications. It&#8217;s a good idea to enable mobile alerts for updates, comments, and assignments related to alarms. Explore all the types of notification <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/notifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">templates</a> available to fully leverage this feature.</p>



<p>For a seamless user experience, you can link notifications to specific mobile dashboards. When an alarm triggers a notification, tapping on it in the mobile app can directly open the relevant dashboard. This integration is set up in the device profile&#8217;s <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/device-profiles/#alarm-rules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alarm rules</a>.</p>



<p>Handling your notifications is intuitive:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Mark as Read</strong>: Swipe right on a notification.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Take Action</strong>: Swipe left to acknowledge, clear, or delete it.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><br>Since launching, our time-series charts have grown a lot but have become harder to configure due to many new features. We decided to make them easier to use and added advanced data zoom capabilities by switching to <a href="https://echarts.apache.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://echarts.apache.org/">Apache ECharts</a>, a popular and powerful charting tool. Below, we&#8217;ll walk through the new widget setup and spotlight the latest enhancements.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Time series chart family</h4>



<p>Our new chart family includes four types. The main one, the <strong>time series</strong> chart, lets you show lines, bars, and points all at once. The others are <strong>line</strong>, <strong>bar</strong>, and <strong>point</strong> charts. We&#8217;ll focus on the basic configuration of the time series chart below. The other charts&#8217; configurations and features are very similar.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Time window and data source</h4>



<p>The <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/widgets/#widget-time-window" data-type="link" data-id="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/dashboards/#timewindow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time window</a> and <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/widgets/#data-source-types" data-type="link" data-id="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/widgets/#data-source-types">data source</a> configurations are similar to other time series widgets. Please note that you may display data from multiple entities using <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/aliases/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/aliases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entity aliases</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="412" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-1024x412.webp" alt="Thingsboard time window and data source configurations" class="wp-image-3749" style="width:798px;height:auto" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-1024x412.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-300x121.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-768x309.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-1536x618.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-2048x824.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-512x206.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-920x370.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-1600x644.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2-1920x772.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Time-window-and-data-source-2.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Y axes</h4>



<p>New charts differ from the old ones by offering direct control over the Y-axes setup, influencing how these axes are shown visually. Each chart comes with a <strong>default</strong> Y axis that is fixed and cannot be removed. Initially, any new series or threshold you add will appear on this default axis. However, you have the option to create additional axes and specify these for your new series or thresholds during their configuration.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="404" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-1024x404.webp" alt="Thingsboard Y-axes setup with default configuration" class="wp-image-3728" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-1024x404.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-300x118.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-768x303.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-1536x606.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-2048x808.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-512x202.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-920x363.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-1600x632.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1-1920x758.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Y-axes_1.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Configurable options for each axis include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Option to toggle the axis visibility. Even if hidden, it affects the chart if min or max values are set.</li>



<li>An optional label for the axis.</li>



<li>Choice of axis placement: left or right side of the chart.</li>



<li>Minimum and maximum values to set the chart&#8217;s visual range. Leaving these empty enables automatic adjustment based on data values.</li>



<li>Units for the values are displayed next to the axis.</li>



<li>The number of decimal places for value precision.</li>



<li>Selection between line or bar for the axis representation.</li>



<li>Additional settings to adjust the appearance of axis ticks and lines.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Series</h4>



<p>The series table lets you set up which time series data keys to show. You can display each series as either a line or bars, and it needs to be linked to a specific Y-axis. When displaying data from several entities together, you can use <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/aliases/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/aliases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entity aliases</a> as the data source. To differentiate between data series from various entities, we recommend including <strong>${entityName} </strong>or <strong>${entityLabel}</strong> in the series label. These placeholders will automatically be replaced with the specific names or labels of the entities, making it easier to tell the series apart.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="409" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-1024x409.webp" alt="Thingsboard series table with default config" class="wp-image-3729" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-1024x409.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-300x120.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-768x307.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-1536x614.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-2048x819.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-512x205.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-920x368.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-1600x640.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series-1920x768.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Series.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Configurable options for each series include:</p>



<ul>
<li>A label for the series. Supports <code>${entityName}</code> or <code>${entityLabel}</code> template parameters.</li>



<li>The display style: choose between a line or a bar.</li>



<li>The color for the line, bar, or points.</li>



<li>Units that are displayed next to the value in tooltips.</li>



<li>The number of decimal places for value precision.</li>



<li>Additional settings for managing the series&#8217; appearance in the legend and other visual aspects.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Thresholds</h4>



<p>Threshold settings have been incorporated into the basic widget configurations, maintaining their full functionality while simplifying the process. There are three ways to set thresholds:</p>



<ul>
<li>Using a constant value for simplicity.</li>



<li>Referencing an attribute from the entity specified in the data source.</li>



<li>Referencing an attribute from a different entity, such as an asset, customer, or tenant, offers flexibility in threshold configuration.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Data zoom</h4>



<p>A valuable new enhancement is the introduction of data zoom functionality. This feature enables you to zoom into specific data points or ranges directly within your browser, efficiently and without the need for additional data requests from the server.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="418" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-1024x418.webp" alt="Long chart with three lines and data zoom option" class="wp-image-3824" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-1024x418.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-300x123.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-768x314.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-1536x627.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-2048x837.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-512x209.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-920x376.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-1600x654.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1-1920x784.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data-zoom-1.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Tooltip improvement</h4>



<p>The tooltip configuration has been updated to offer more flexibility in formatting data and showing the data&#8217;s time interval. By default, the tooltip will show both the start and end times of the data aggregation period. You now have the option to customize the font and colors for both the actual values and the date labels, as well as the tooltip&#8217;s background, to suit your preferences.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="634" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Tooltip-improvement_1-1024x634.webp" alt="Chart which is showing bars and lines

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Other EChart-based widgets</h4>



<p>We have added a few more widgets with slightly different configurations.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Bar chart with labels</h5>



<p>The widget is crafted to compare aggregated data across various entities or multiple data keys. To differentiate between data from different entities, incorporate <code>${entityName}</code> or <code>${entityLabel}</code> into the series label.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1812" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels.webp" alt="Thingsboard bar chart with labels" class="wp-image-3734" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-300x226.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-1024x770.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-768x578.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-1536x1155.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-2048x1540.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-512x385.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-920x692.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-1600x1203.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bar-chart-with-labels-1920x1444.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Range chart</h4>



<p>The range chart is specifically created to display a single time-series value from one entity, such as a device or asset. A distinctive feature of this chart is the &#8220;Range Colors&#8221; option. This allows you to assign specific colors to different value ranges shown in the chart, enabling a visual representation that matches the value&#8217;s magnitude with color.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="770" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-1024x770.webp" alt="Thingsboard range chart which is showing temperature on a time period " class="wp-image-3735" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-1024x770.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-300x226.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-768x578.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-1536x1155.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-2048x1540.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-512x385.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-920x692.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-1600x1203.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart-1920x1444.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Range-chart.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p style="font-size:16px">Ensuring reliable and consistent monitoring of temperature and humidity is crucial for the proper storage of temperature-sensitive medications and perishable food products. Our partner, <a href="https://www.vypin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vypin</a>, has successfully deployed WhereView, a solution powered by ThingsBoard, for a leading global pharmaceutical corporation. This IoT application has significantly enhanced operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="803" height="451" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5.webp" alt="Working conditions on the left side and device on the right side" class="wp-image-3797" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5.webp 803w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-300x168.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-768x431.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-512x288.webp 512w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The challenge</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) imposes stringent guidelines on pharmaceutical manufacturers concerning storage conditions and the regulatory compliance of control systems. The client approached Vypin with a request to overhaul their existing system, which failed to meet FDA standards, leading to penalties and the potential for product or ingredient spoilage.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The client&#8217;s primary concerns revolved around data loss. The then-existing devices were prone to disconnections due to various issues, such as network or power failures, leading to lapses in telemetry transmission or recording. Furthermore, the system lacked a mechanism for notifying the client about these disruptions. Additionally, there was no provision for remote access to monitoring data.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="is-style-cs-about" style="font-size:16px">Round-the-clock rotation of operators to control the temperature and humidity in the warehouse indeed is not the best solution. Therefore, in the regular automatic reports related to the storage environment state there were gaps in the tables and graphs. The FDA fines for such violations.</p>
<cite>Customer officer says</cite></blockquote>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left">The solution</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">In response, Vypin proposed the Vypin-WhereView system, leveraging ThingsBoard&#8217;s capabilities. The solution involved establishing a wireless network, along with the installation of sensors and gateways.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Addressing the initial concern of data loss, the newly installed sensors were equipped with memory modules to store telemetry data locally. Thus, even in the event of a gateway disconnection, data integrity was maintained. Upon restoration of the gateway&#8217;s online status, it would retrieve and transmit the stored telemetry to WhereView.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="893" height="407" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/temp_hum_dashboard210923.webp" alt="Screen with opened dashboard and devices in front" class="wp-image-3800" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/temp_hum_dashboard210923.webp 893w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/temp_hum_dashboard210923-300x137.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/temp_hum_dashboard210923-768x350.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/temp_hum_dashboard210923-512x233.webp 512w" sizes="(max-width: 893px) 100vw, 893px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">The WareView application, powered by ThingsBoard, resolved the outstanding concerns of reliable data processing and storage and enabled differentiated access levels. Designated personnel were granted comprehensive access, allowing them to monitor data from all warehouses at any time and location. In contrast, warehouse managers were provided with tailored access rights, enabling them to oversee only their specific warehouses.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="803" height="460" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/6.webp" alt="Two windows with alarms information  and dashboard" class="wp-image-3799" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/6.webp 803w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/6-300x172.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/6-768x440.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/6-512x293.webp 512w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">Accessing the dashboard, which displays various graphs and tables, simply requires logging into the system from a web browser.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">A noteworthy feature is the customized notification system, established through ThingsBoard&#8217;s rule engine and device profiles. This system alerts the relevant individuals in case of deviations from preset conditions, such as temperature threshold breaches. This feature facilitates immediate response and the implementation of preventive measures.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left">The outcome</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Prevention is universally acknowledged as more efficient, cost-effective, and less time-consuming than cure. With the newly installed warehouse monitoring system, the client now has the capability to proactively prevent issues before they arise, ensuring the safety and integrity of their sensitive products.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">This case study exemplifies the power of IoT in enhancing regulatory compliance and operational efficiency in critical industries such as pharmaceuticals. The Vypin-WhereView solution, backed by ThingsBoard, demonstrates our commitment to delivering innovative and reliable monitoring solutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p style="font-size:16px">Welcome to the latest update from the ThingsBoard team! Our ongoing mission to improve the platform&#8217;s functionality and user experience brings us to the introduction of four innovative IoT widgets: the &#8220;Action button,&#8221; &#8220;Command button,&#8221; &#8220;Toggle button,&#8221; and &#8220;Power button.&#8221; Designed with a focus on usability, these new buttons are tailored for the most common IoT use cases, offering users enhanced control and flexibility in managing their IoT devices and dashboards. Let&#8217;s dive into their capabilities.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Action button widget</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">This button facilitates single-click navigation to other dashboards, states, or custom actions. You may choose one of the common <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/widget-actions">widget actions</a> to be triggered when the user clicks the button. You may also choose whether the button is in default, activated, or disabled state. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2406" height="441" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons.webp" alt="Tree buttons with different clicking states " class="wp-image-3716" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons.webp 2406w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-300x55.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-1024x188.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-768x141.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-1536x282.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-2048x375.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-512x94.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-920x169.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-1600x293.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Buttons-1920x352.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2406px) 100vw, 2406px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">More importantly, the button may dynamically change its state based on the value of the attribute or time-series subscription. You may find an example of the button that changes its state when the user attribute is updated below: </p>



<div class="wp-block-file">
<a id="wp-block-file--media-2b8b2412-a70d-486d-bfd5-d21e65230e9a" href="https://thingsboard.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tb_dynamic_button_states.json">tb_dynamic_button_states</a><a href="https://thingsboard.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tb_dynamic_button_states.json" class="wp-block-file__button wp-element-button" download="" aria-describedby="wp-block-file--media-2b8b2412-a70d-486d-bfd5-d21e65230e9a">tb_dynamic_button_states.json</a>
</div>



<p style="font-size:16px">The behavior configuration is available in the basic widget settings:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1353" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2.webp" alt="Thingsboard basic widget settings" class="wp-image-3718" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-300x168.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-1024x575.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-768x431.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-1536x863.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-2048x1150.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-512x288.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-920x517.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-1600x899.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Add-widget-2-1920x1078.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">The button appearance is highly customizable. You may choose one of four available layouts, configure icons, and label appearance. The colors of the buttons are configured via main and background color palettes. By default, the button uses a palette configured in the <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/pe/user-guide/white-labeling/">white-labeling settings</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1626" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-3899" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-300x202.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-1024x691.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-768x518.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-1536x1037.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-2048x1382.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-512x346.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-920x621.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-1600x1080.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Appearance-3-1-1920x1296.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">Although the button supports all common <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/widget-actions">widget actions</a>, we will highlight only the most popular in this article. To demonstrate them, we have prepared the dashboard that you may <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/dashboards/#import-dashboard">import</a> to your platform instance.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1353" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases.webp" alt="Thingsboard dashboard with five blocks which are demonstrating widget actions capabilities " class="wp-image-3722" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-300x168.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-1024x575.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-768x431.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-1536x863.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-2048x1150.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-512x288.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-920x517.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-1600x899.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Button-use-cases-1920x1078.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px">You may find the sample dashboard JSON below: </p>



<div class="wp-block-file"><a id="wp-block-file--media-fd741ad2-e692-4a03-9a23-812a9f191991" href="https://thingsboard.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/button_use_cases.json">button_use_cases</a><a href="https://thingsboard.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/button_use_cases.json" class="wp-block-file__button wp-element-button" download aria-describedby="wp-block-file--media-fd741ad2-e692-4a03-9a23-812a9f191991"></a></div>



<p style="font-size:16px">The dashboard has two states: &#8220;default&#8221; and &#8220;other&#8221;. The default state contains 5 showcase buttons. The &#8220;other&#8221; state contains a line chart widget with random data. Let&#8217;s review each button below:</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>•</strong> <strong>Open dialog</strong> button uses &#8220;Navigate to new dashboard state&#8221; with the &#8220;Open in separate dialog&#8221; display option. So, the user will see the line chart opened in a modal window.</p>

</figure>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>•</strong> <strong>Open popup</strong> button is similar, but the &#8220;Open in popover&#8221; display option is used. You may also explore various options for the &#8220;Preferred popover placement&#8221; option. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="720" height="372" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Open_pop-up-1.gif" alt="Opening popup which shows chart" class="wp-image-3567" style="width:802px;height:auto"/></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>•</strong> <strong>Change state</strong> button simply update the current dashboard state to the new one. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="722" height="372" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Change_state.gif" alt="Opening another dashboard state after clicking on the button" class="wp-image-3570"/></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>•</strong> <strong>Drill down</strong> button is similar, but instead of changing the dashboard state, it leaves the old one in the stack. </p>

<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>•</strong> <strong>Open URL</strong> provides the ability to open external or relative URLs in the same or separate browser tab. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Command button widget</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The Command button widget is designed to perform three key actions: sending <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/rpc/">commands</a> to devices, updating <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/attributes/">attributes</a>, or appending <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/telemetry/">time-series</a> data. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px">You can specify a single device to carry out your chosen action, such as receiving a command. For those familiar with the platform, there&#8217;s an option to use <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/aliases/">entity aliases</a> for targeting. This means you&#8217;re not limited to devices; you can target assets, users, or other entities capable of supporting attribute updates or time-series data additions. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px">Behavior settings enable the definition of the on-click action and condition when the button is disabled. More importantly, the button may dynamically become enabled or disabled based on attribute or time-series subscription. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Execute RPC action</strong> allows you to send the command to the device. You may configure the command (method) name and parameters of the command. The parameter value may be configured as a constant or result of function execution. You may send the command without parameters by choosing the &#8220;None&#8221; option.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1542" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Execute-RPC-action-7.webp" alt="Form with three fields and apply button" class="wp-image-3736" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Execute-RPC-action-7.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Execute-RPC-action-7-300x192.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Execute-RPC-action-7-1024x655.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Execute-RPC-action-7-768x492.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Execute-RPC-action-7-1536x983.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Execute-RPC-action-7-2048x1311.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Execute-RPC-action-7-512x328.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Execute-RPC-action-7-920x589.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Execute-RPC-action-7-1600x1024.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Execute-RPC-action-7-1920x1229.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure></div>


<p style="font-size:16px">By default, we use an un-persisted command with 5 seconds timeout. You may change the command parameters in the advanced settings of the action.</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Set attribute action</strong> allows you to set or update the value of the particular entity attribute. The action configuration form allows you to configure the scope, key, and value of the attribute. The attribute value may be configured as a constant or result of function execution. Please note that only devices support &#8220;shared&#8221; attribute scope. You must choose the &#8220;server&#8221; scope for all other entities. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p style="font-size:16px"><strong>Add time-series action</strong> allows you to add the new time-series value for the particular entity. The action configuration form allows you to configure the time-series data key and value. The value may be configured as a constant or result of function execution. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p style="font-size:16px">You may dynamically disable the button based on certain values of the attribute or time-series key. For example, the dashboard attached below contains two buttons that switch the state of the user&#8217;s attribute &#8220;state&#8221;. When the user presses button A, it becomes disabled, and vice versa.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2409" height="1353" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disabled-state-10.webp" alt="Thingsboard dashboard with two buttons which are change dashboard states" class="wp-image-3744" style="width:822px;height:auto" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disabled-state-10.webp 2409w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disabled-state-10-300x168.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disabled-state-10-1024x575.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disabled-state-10-768x431.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disabled-state-10-1536x863.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disabled-state-10-2048x1150.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disabled-state-10-512x288.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disabled-state-10-920x517.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disabled-state-10-1600x899.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Disabled-state-10-1920x1078.webp 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2409px) 100vw, 2409px" /></figure></div>


<p style="font-size:16px">You may find the sample dashboard JSON below: </p>



<div class="wp-block-file"><a id="wp-block-file--media-8508d6eb-4fb5-4e33-b266-136f058048ae" href="https://thingsboard.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/command_buttons.json">command_buttons</a><a href="https://thingsboard.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/command_buttons.json" class="wp-block-file__button wp-element-button" download aria-describedby="wp-block-file--media-8508d6eb-4fb5-4e33-b266-136f058048ae">Download</a></div>



<p style="font-size:16px">Alternatively, you may disable the button that sends the command to the device, if the device is offline. For this purpose, you may just use the value of the &#8220;active&#8221; attribute or time-series key. </p>



<p style="font-size:16px">The appearance settings for the Command button are identical to those of the Action button. The primary applications of the Command button are straightforward, focusing on managing devices and assets. This involves either issuing commands or updating attributes to control their operation.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Toggle button widget</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">The Toggle button widget shares many similarities with the Command button widget, but with a crucial distinction: it features two distinct states, &#8220;checked&#8221; and &#8220;unchecked&#8221;. This design allows it to perform two specific actions, &#8220;Check&#8221; and &#8220;Uncheck&#8221;, depending on its state. Users have the flexibility to fully customize the appearance of the button for both states, enhancing its visual and functional integration into their dashboards.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Introduction&nbsp;</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">Equipment in production plays an important role in achieving maximum efficiency, quality, and payback. The issues that are key to optimizing the use of equipment are:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Underutilization of Equipment</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Ineffective Production Scheduling</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Excessive Wear and Tear on Machinery</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Operational Bottlenecks</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Suboptimal Maintenance Scheduling</li>



<li style="font-size:16px">Misaligned Capacity Planning</li>
</ul>



<p style="font-size:16px">Solving these problems requires constant monitoring of equipment utilization and performance metrics. As production output increases, manufacturers may need to partially or completely change their equipment maintenance strategies and schedules to maintain efficiency. Unfortunately, these problems cannot be solved once and for all. But it also means that we can endlessly improve the optimization process.&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-size:16px">That is why having the most up-to-date data is important when choosing an optimization strategy. Previously, with the help of logging, you could see how the equipment worked at the end of the day or week. With the growth of technology and the help of IoT devices, we can receive raw data in real-time. With advanced analytics, you can turn raw data into meaningful reports and predict future equipment behavior using machine learning models.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Equipment Utilization</h4>



<p style="font-size:16px">To understand the overall condition of the equipment, you need to operate with a significant number of KPIs. We have divided KPIs by the problems they solve:</p>



<p style="font-size:16px"><em>Underutilization of Equipment and Operational Bottlenecks</em></p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Production Output &#8211; A numerical or quality indicator of the useful action performed by the equipment. The information is collected using counters, scales, or quality sensors transmitted via the network to the ThingsBoard. The data does not require any additional processing.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Equipment Utilization Rate &#8211; measures the degree to which equipment is utilized over a period compared to its full potential or capacity. Production Output is taken as the current capacity indicator. The maximum capacity is set according to the technical documentation. The indicator is calculated by an analytics system that finds the ratio of Production Output to Maximum Capacity in real-time.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Percentage of defects &#8211; The number of defects concerning the Production Output. Defective products are automatically detected using computer vision, ultrasonic or X-ray inspection, or by using manual inspection. The advanced analytics system calculates it in real-time by comparing the number of defective products to the manufactured product.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size:16px"><em>Ineffective Production Scheduling</em></p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Throughput &#8211; Measuring the rate at which products are produced on a machine, line, plant, or across the entire company. Throughput is calculated from meters installed at the inlet and outlet of each production line. After that, the advanced analytics system converts the raw data of time indicators into a ready-made report of the time it took the equipment to perform a certain action.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Time-Based Measurement &#8211; tracks how long the equipment is actively used during a defined period, such as a shift or a day. This measurement is crucial as it reveals the actual usage versus the potential capacity, highlighting whether the equipment is being underutilized or overused. Information is collected using IoT devices or functions built into the equipment. After that, raw time data is translated into a ready-made KPI indicator using advanced analytics.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="641" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Time-Based-Measurement-1024x641.webp" alt="Grid which shows how long the equipment is actively used during a defined period" class="wp-image-3779" srcset="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Time-Based-Measurement-1024x641.webp 1024w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Time-Based-Measurement-300x188.webp 300w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Time-Based-Measurement-768x481.webp 768w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Time-Based-Measurement-1536x962.webp 1536w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Time-Based-Measurement-2048x1283.webp 2048w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Time-Based-Measurement-512x321.webp 512w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Time-Based-Measurement-920x576.webp 920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Time-Based-Measurement-1600x1002.webp 1600w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Time-Based-Measurement-1920x1203.webp 1920w, /blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eu-Time-Based-Measurement.webp 2409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p style="font-size:16px"><em>Excessive Wear and Tear on Machinery and Suboptimal Maintenance Scheduling</em></p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Downtime and Uptime </strong>&#8211;&nbsp; Uptime refers to the duration when the equipment is running and available for use, directly contributing to productivity. Downtime, on the other hand, represents periods when the equipment is non-operational due to maintenance, breakdowns, or other issues. These metrics are crucial for understanding the reliability and efficiency of equipment. Information is collected using IoT devices or functions built into the equipment. The data does not require any additional processing.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)</strong> &#8211; This measures the average time it takes to repair equipment after a failure. A lower MTTR helps in reducing downtime and maintaining productivity.&nbsp; This indicator uses the same metrics for calculation as the Downtime and Uptime KPIs. After collecting the data, the advanced analytics system calculates the average value among the time indicators and provides a ready-made report.&nbsp;</li>

<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px">Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) &#8211; This KPI measures the average time between equipment failures. A higher MTBF indicates more reliable equipment. This indicator uses the same metrics for calculation as the Downtime and Uptime KPIs. After collecting the data, the advanced analytics system calculates the average value among the time indicators and provides a ready-made report.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p style="font-size:16px">Based on the indicators, this method helps to track production and has more opportunities to react proactively or to problems. Thus, the use of advanced analytics gives us access to:</p>



<ul>
<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Maximizing Efficiency:</strong> Companies can identify underused resources by measuring how much equipment is used compared to its full potential. This helps make adjustments to increase efficiency, ensuring that the equipment is not just sitting idle when it could contribute to production.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Cost Optimization:</strong> Equipment represents a significant investment for any business. Measuring its utilization helps understand whether the company is getting the most out of this investment. If equipment isn&#8217;t used effectively, it could lead to unnecessary expenses like paying for machines that aren&#8217;t contributing to revenue generation.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Improving Production Planning:</strong> Equipment utilization data is crucial for effective production scheduling. It helps align the use of machinery with production demands, ensuring that the right equipment is available and operational when needed.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Reducing Wear and Tear:</strong> Overuse of equipment can lead to increased maintenance needs and shorter lifespans for machinery. By monitoring utilization, companies can balance the workload on equipment to prevent excessive wear and tear.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Identifying Bottlenecks:</strong> Low utilization rates can signal bottlenecks where equipment is not used effectively in production. This can lead to insights about process inefficiencies or the need to reallocate resources.</li>



<li style="font-size:16px"><strong>Maintenance Scheduling:</strong> Knowing how frequently and intensely equipment is used informs maintenance schedules. Instead of following a rigid maintenance calendar, companies can plan maintenance based on actual usage, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h4>
